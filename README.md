OOP workout tracking system 

What does this system do?
This workout tracking system that I just created lets a user record all of their exercises and it will organize them for the user.  For each exercise you have to add in how long it was and other information about it, so the system can figure out how many calories were burnt. The system will also add up all the time you took to complete your exercises, and will display a clear summary of your entire workout at the end of the user putting in all the information. 

What OOP concepts does it demonstrate?
This system shows off alot of object-oriented concepts. A few of them being the classes and objects concept. In this system these were used to represent the diffrent exercises and the workouts. This system also shows off the use of inheritance, when you create the different exercise types, since its inheriting the types from the Exercise class. Lastly, it shows off encapsulation, since the exercise list is privite inside a different class, but we can access it through methods.
