OOP workout tracking system 
Reflection questions:
The src structure makes it so you seperate your real code, and tests, to make sure that the project stays clean and to follow the best practices, and layout. 
We do this so that it will call the parent class first before it calls the sub-class to avoid problems. 
It allows us to reuse methods that we used in subclasses so that we dont have to waste time writing it out again we can just eruse it. 
Tests show us what is expected out of the code, and we can use these tests to find out what is going wrong and what you need to change n order for the test to work. 
We do this so that the main branch is always production ready, and is open, and clean for us when we need to actually go throug with the code we just created.
